# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to see the number of employees at Pewlett Hackard that are nearing retirement, the job titles of those employees, and the number of retirement ready employees that would be capable of mentoring other employees for those roles. This data will be used to recommend a path to take for the company going forward regarding retiring employees.

## Analysis
### Total Retiring Employees:
A retiring employee in this instance is considered to be an employee that was born between January 1 1952, and December 31 1955.

The image above is the top results of a query listing all retiring employees as well as the total number of rows (which is our total number of expected retirees). We can see that there are 72458 employees that are expected to be retiring. Pewlett Hackard has 300,024 total employees at this time, which means that around 24.2% of all Pewlett Hackard employees have a retirement date coming up. This may be a high amount, but there is still time to perform hiring and training to fill those positions.

### Retiring Positions: 
To get a better grasp of who is retiring from the company we should take a look at the number of people retiring from each position within the company.

This is the total number of employees leaving by position. A large majority of the people with an expected retirement date coming up are either senior engineers or senior staff. 50,842 of the 72,458 retiring employees, or 70% of the retiring employees, fit into this senior engineer/senior staff group. Using this we can start to get a better idea of what areas the company needs to prioritize while hiring and training from now on. 

### Possible Mentors:
The employees best suited to mentoring those that will be filling the retiring positions are the employees that are retiring. In order to make sure that the right mentors are chosen, a query will be made to find all employees that are retiring that were born in the year 1965.

Here we can see that 1,549 meet the mentorship standards of Pewlett Hackard and would be availabe to start the mentorship process for incoming or existing employees. 

### Mentor Positions:
While having a grasp on the total number of employees that would qualify as mentors, it was noted above that a majority of the retiring employees are either senior engineers or senior staff.

Many of the mentors are either senior staff, senior engineers, or engineers. While there are many times more senior engineers and staff retiring, every mentor could work to train multiple people into the emptying positions over time. 

## Analysis Summary
It is clear from the results above the Pewlett Hackard as a company has its work cut out for it when it comes to filling all positions after this retirement wave happens, but at least now a goal can be set for the company to work toward and a path can be followed. The total amount of employees that will need their positions filled is 72,458. With 1,549 possible mentors at the company this means that every mentor will have to help with training and mentoring multiple employees with no exceptions. 

There have been fears about the number of senior staff and senior engineers that will be retiring, but of the current Pewlett Hackard employees (including those that will be retiring) it is clear from the report below that these positions just generally make up a high percentage of employees at the company.

While the effects of these departures will surely be felt, the company is still in a strong position with the remaining employees and the mentorship program that will begin.
